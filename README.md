#### zulip-bot providing random number generation and game objects

This bot is designed to respond to requests for coin flips and dice rolls, currently it can respond to `coin` with a single coin flip and `dice` with a single D6 roll. It also has a help function on `help` and responds to any other kind of message with a generic humanesque response. A closer look at the code will tell you it is designed for much more than this however and there is much intention for improvement. The intent is to remove the parsing limitations and parse a variation of messages from very explicit to strealined with a great deal more commands included. Hopefully in time it will have functionality for, multiple requests, a choice of faces for the dice, weightings to create trick coins and loaded dice, simple mathematical functions on outputs, better IO handling, more descriptive help messaging, standard random number generation, and a card based system.
