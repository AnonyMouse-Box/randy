Created program complete with witty retorts, error handling and help function

Name: Randy
Synopsis:
{curly braces define optional input}
------------
Coin; @randy {<times> }c{oins weight <heads>:<tails>:<clumsy>}
Examples; long:- `@randy 20 coin weight 20:10:30`, short:- `@randy 20cw2:1:3`
------------
Dice; @randy {<times> }d{ice <faces>,<stop>,<step> weight <number> <load>:<rest>:<clumsy> <operand>}
Examples; long:- `@randy 20 dice 16,24,2 weight 16 20:10:30 +89`, short:- `@randy 20d16,24,2w16 20:10:30+89`
------------
Times - the number of times the action will be performed, with dice all results will be automatically accumulated and a final result given.
Coin - the command used to define a coin flip.
Dice - the command used to define a dice roll.
Faces - the number of faces you want the die to have, becomes dice start value when stop and step are defined, with a default of 1.
Stop - defines what number to stop at when deciding the size of the dice. Both start and stop are inclusive so put the number you would expect on the dice.
Step - defines what the increments on the dice should be.
Weight - the command given to inform that you wish to edit the weightings.
Number - the number on the dice you wish to load. This must be followed by a space and then the ratio else it will default to 2:1.
Heads - the weighting you wish heads to have. Weightings should be integer ratios, larger numbers mean it is more likely lower is less likely.
Load - the weighting you wish the load number to have.
Tails - the weighting you wish tails to have.
Rest - the weighting you wish the rest of the numbers to have.
Clumsy - this is a weighting with a default of 0 that allows the potential for the item to be lost during operation.
Operand - this defines an operand  `+`, `-`, `/`, or `*` that you can perform upon the accumulated dice rolls. This is mostly useful for applying buffs or debuffs.
